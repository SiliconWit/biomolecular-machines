## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### Spiral Motion Characteristics

The research reveals that microtubules exhibit distinct spiral trajectories when driven by kinesin motors under specific conditions. These patterns are characterized by:

- **Pitch Variation**: Regular spacing between spiral coils that depends on motor density
- **Radius Control**: Spiral radius that can be modulated by experimental parameters
- **Handedness**: Consistent chirality in the spiral patterns observed
- **Stability**: Persistent spiral motion over extended time periods

### Motor Density Dependencies

<Steps>

1. **Low Density Regime**
   
   At low motor densities, microtubules exhibit predominantly linear motion with occasional directional changes.

2. **Critical Density**
   
   A critical motor density threshold exists beyond which spiral motion becomes dominant over linear gliding.

3. **High Density Regime**
   
   At high motor densities, tight spiral patterns emerge with consistent geometric parameters.

4. **Saturation Effects**
   
   Beyond optimal density, motor interference reduces spiral regularity and motion efficiency.

</Steps>

### Cellular Context

The spiralling behavior observed in vitro may reflect important biological functions:

- **Cytoplasmic Mixing**: Spiral trajectories could enhance mixing of cellular contents
- **Organelle Positioning**: Complex paths may facilitate optimal organelle distribution
