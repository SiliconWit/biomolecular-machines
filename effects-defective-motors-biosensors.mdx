### Defect Type Analysis

<Steps>

1. **Velocity-Reduced Motors**
   
   Motors with reduced stepping velocity create bottlenecks in transport, significantly impacting overall system speed and efficiency.

2. **Stalled Motors**
   
   Motors that bind but cannot move create obstacles for other motors, leading to traffic jams and reduced transport capacity.

3. **Detachment-Prone Motors**
   
   Motors with compromised binding create gaps in transport coverage, reducing system reliability and increasing variability.

4. **Force-Impaired Motors**
   
   Motors with reduced force generation struggle with cargo transport, particularly affecting heavy-load applications.

</Steps>

### Performance Degradation Patterns

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linear Effects">
    ### Proportional Degradation
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - Performance decreases proportionally with defect percentage
    - Predictable degradation patterns
    - Suitable for simple optimization approaches
    
    **Examples**:
    - Transport speed reduction with velocity-impaired motors
    - Signal strength decrease with partially functional motors
    - Throughput reduction with detachment-prone motors
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Threshold Effects">
    ### Critical Point Behavior
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - System maintains performance until critical defect threshold
    - Rapid performance collapse beyond threshold
    - Requires careful system design to avoid critical points
    
    **Examples**:
    - Complete transport failure with excessive stalled motors
    - Signal loss with too many non-functional motors
    - System instability beyond critical defect levels
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Nonlinear Effects">
    ### Complex Degradation
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - Performance degradation shows complex, nonlinear behavior
    - Synergistic effects between different defect types
    - Requires sophisticated modeling and optimization
    
    **Examples**:
    - Amplified effects when multiple defect types combine
    - Emergent failure modes not predictable from single defects
    - System-level breakdowns from component interactions
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Resilience Mechanisms

The research identifies several key mechanisms that provide resilience against motor defects:

#### Redundancy-Based Resilience
- **Multiple Motor Pathways**: Systems with parallel transport routes can compensate for defective pathways
- **Motor Population Diversity**: Heterogeneous motor populations provide backup capabilities

- **Over-Engineering**: Excess motor capacity allows continued function despite defects

#### Adaptive Mechanisms
- **Dynamic Recruitment**: Systems can recruit additional motors to compensate for defects
- **Load Balancing**: Transport load can be redistributed among functional motors
- **Pathway Switching**: Alternative routes can be activated when primary pathways fail

#### Cooperative Effects
- **Motor Teamwork**: Multiple motors working together can compensate for individual defects
- **Collective Behavior**: Group dynamics can overcome individual motor limitations
- **Emergent Properties**: System-level capabilities that exceed individual motor capabilities
